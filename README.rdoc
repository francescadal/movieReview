Movie review site
This app is built with rails also using views/layout. Everything is in the back-end repo 

Unreached Goals
I wanted to be able to connect to the IMDB api. That is something i am going ot be working on implementing.
I want the users to be able to create reviews on other movies.This was part idea of love and part major internet help. (It was crunch time)
